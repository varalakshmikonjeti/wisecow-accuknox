Introduction
The goal of this assignment was to containerize and deploy the Wisecow application on a
Kubernetes environment (Minikube) with secure TLS communication. The process involved
Dockerizing the app, deploying it on Kubernetes using Deployment and Service manifests, and
exposing it via NodePort and Ingress with TLS enabled.
Steps Followed
1. Cloned the Wisecow GitHub repository.
2. Created a Dockerfile and built the Docker image:
docker build -t wisecow-app:latest .
3. Applied the Kubernetes Deployment manifest.
4. Applied the Kubernetes Service manifest.
5. Verified that the Pod was running and Service was exposed.
6. Accessed the application using:
- http://127.0.0.1:54202/
- https://wisecow.local/ (via TLS Ingress).

Execution & Outputs
The following screenshots show the results of deployment and verification steps.

Step 1: Application Running on Localhost
Verified the application runs on port 4499 in local environment.

Step 2: Exposing the Service via Minikube
Created Kubernetes service and exposed it using NodePort. Accessed through minikube service command.

Step 3: Application Accessible via CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
Configured GitHub Actions pipeline to build and verify the app. Workflow executed successfully.

Conclusion
The Wisecow app was successfully containerized, deployed on Kubernetes (Minikube), exposed
via NodePort & Ingress with TLS, and integrated with GitHub Actions CI pipeline. All steps are
verified with screenshots.
